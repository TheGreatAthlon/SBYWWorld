zone 4 11 0 30 A small table, with nothing on it. Well that's kind of boring, isn't it?

zone 8 8 0 30 A small book, sitting on the table. Yeah I know, I said the table was empty, but looks like I lied. Oh well.
txt 8 4 The title of the book is "How to be a foo, By Foowords." All the pages seem glued together though,so you can't open it. Sad.
txt 1 0 If you would like to make changes, you can fork this repo. You can also make a forked map of it so you can use the builder. Then, after that, you type /rawmap, do those changes, and then make that be the file. If you need any help, feel free to ask other players. Thanks, and have fun with my idea!
